Traction Torque: Friction, an angular force that the road applies to the wheel
Drive Torque: An angular force that the engine creates
Drive Force: The force the wheels exert on the road
Traction Force: A linear/longitudinal force that moves the car


Drive Torque: (engineTorque * gearRatio * diffRatio * efficiency)
Drive Force: driveTorque / wheelRadius
Engine RPM: wheelRotSec * gearRatio * diffRatio * 60 / 2 pi
Wheel r/s(easy): speed(m/s) / wheelRadius
	Less accurate, unable to simulate wheel spinouts, etc.
Wheel r/s: wheelRotSec + (((driveTorque + breakTorque + tractionTorque) / inertia) * time)
	break and traction torque are opposite to the drive torque(usually negative)

What to track:
	Drive wheel rpms and how it changes over time due to the torque upon them

Non-Driving Wheels:
	Angular Velocity: speed / 2pi * radius
Driving Wheels: Slightly faster than "free" wheels
	Rotating slightly faster means they always slip the slipping causes friction 
	 in the opposite of the slip, causing movement, traction or longitudinal force.
	 The traction force is dependent on the amount of slip. The traction torque on
	 the wheels is the angular force the road applies to the wheel, or friction, 
	 which acts in opposition to the drive torque
	Traction Torque: tractionForce * wheelRadius
	Slip: ((wheel angular velocity) * (radius) - speed(m/s)) / abs(speed(m/s))
	When braking with locked wheels the slip-ratio is -1, more slip occurs past 1
		
Net Torque: The net torque acting on a wheel's axle
	torque = driveTorque + tractionTorque(both wheels) + brakeTorque
	angularAccel = torque / wheelInertia
		wheelInertia ~= mass * radius^2 / 2
		
normalized = force / load
force = normalized * load

		
IN TOTAL:
	Free Wheels:
		Angular Velocity: speed / 2pi * radius
	Drive Wheels:
		Traction Torque: tractionForce * wheelRadius
			The torque that opposes the car
		Slip-Ratio: ((wheel angular velocity) * (radius) - speed(m/s)) / abs(speed(m/s))
			The amount of slip, that allows the car to move/accelerate
		Traction Force: normalizedForce * load(weight on wheel) or curveConstant * slipRatio
			The force that moves the car
		Net Torque: driveTorque + tractionTorque(both wheels) + brakeTorque
			The net torque on the wheel, positive drives the car forward
		Inertia(approx): mass * radius^2 / 2
			The inertia of the wheel
		Angular Acceleration = torque / inertia
			The angular acceleration of the wheel in radians
		Angular Velocity: angularVelocity + angularAccel * deltaTime
			The angular velocity(like RPM) of the wheel
		Longitudinal Friction Coefficient: horizontalForce / verticalForce(wheight on wheel)
